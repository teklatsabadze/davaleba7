<p><b>Loren Ipsum </b> is simply dummy <u>text</u> of the printing and typesetting industry. <br>

    <i><P><B>Loren Ipsum</B> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the <mark>1500s</mark>, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</P></i>
    It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <mark>1960s</mark> with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <del><b>Aldus PageMaker</b></del> including versions of Lorem Ipsum</p>
